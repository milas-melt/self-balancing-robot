# arduino self banlancing robot

old project of a robot that can balance itself using pid control. Here's an example of what it looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUbBUd-hBLI

-   test_WheelsAndSensor --> Moves the weels forward and backward. Tests the sensor (btw IMU needs to be calibrated for good PVM control)
-   balance.ino, balance2.ino --> PD control
-   balance3.ino --> PID control
-   sensorCalib --> install MPU6050 by Electronic Cats library
